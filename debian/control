Description: Lazy sequence library for go
 Seq is a lazy sequence library for go. It is inspired by Clojure's
 sequence functions. It originally started because I was interested in
 transducers and wanted to play with them. Most of the functions in
 the library are implemeneted as transducers in the
 jsouthworth.net/go/transduce library and wrapped with a XfrmSequence
 here. This library relies heavily on reflection to allow for the most
 flexibility in what the user provides. This means that it is only
 type checked at runtime.
